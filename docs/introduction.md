##Introduction
HTML, CSS and JavScript were built to be used on sites that are very different
from the web applications that we're currently building. This dictates the
need to abandon the traditional way of creating webpages, and implement a
framework that mirrors the way applications are programatically architected.
That is, we should borrow from other web domains, and apply those best
practices to web design: modularity, a separation of concerns, DRY,
encapsulation, convention, etc.

###Difficulties
On smaller/short-lived projects, it's often okay to not worry about scalablity
and how the current approach will impact future design and development.
However, on web applications that are expected to evolve over time, laying a
strong structure is imperative; itâ€™s much easier to start with a good structure
than to change it later.

The benefits laid out herein will be negligble, and may in fact cause
discomfort on a small scale. However, as the application grows in complexity
and dyanmism, the efforts will gradually be more appreciated.

###The Future
This framework hopes to advance the development of front-end architecture along
the same lines as much of the web is already going. Many projects are helping
to teach developers the power of modularized code, and this framework hopes to
serve as a base implemenetation and set of conventions of that approach,
specifically for the front-end.

###Inspiration
Inspiration for this framework comes from methodologies such as
[OOCSS](http://oocss.org/), [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/),
[BEM](http://bem.info/) and
[Atomic Design](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/). Writing
this framework has meant humbly standing on the shoulders of giants like
[Nicole Sullivan](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/),
[Nicolas Gallagher](http://nicolasgallagher.com/),
[Jonathan Snook](http://snook.ca/) and
[Harry Roberts](http://csswizardry.com/). This framework exists because of
their efforts and leadership.
