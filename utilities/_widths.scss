/**
 * Utility widths
 *
 * Builds out a series of width utility components. These are most commonly used
 * when building a grid as an adjacent class of the `grid-col` elements. The
 * generated widths are all percentage based.
 *
 * 1. If responsive, will generate width components that are prefixed according
 *    to the `$sizes` list.
 * 2. Relies on the `create-cols` mixin, which itself relies on the `gridCalc`
 *    function.
